# Automated-Segmentation-Anatomies-Brain-CT

The network architecture is based on LiviaNet https://github.com/josedolz/LiviaNET here Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with fully convolutional layers and deeper architecture via small convolution kernels The features are combined across multiple scales. The performance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient. There are changes done to the model by adding pre-trained weight in order to relsove the challenge of segmenation of different shapes.  

This project reduces the labour intensive operation of segmentation, help Radiologist analysis and visualize tumors, blood cots and masses in medical images better.
